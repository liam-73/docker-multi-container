This is a sample project that demonstrates how to build & deploy a Docker multi-container application using Travis CI to an AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment. The application consists of four containers: a client, a server, a worker, and an Nginx reverse proxy.

  Before you can deploy the application, you need to have the following software installed:

   - Docker
   - Docker Compose
   - AWS CLI
  
  You also need to have an AWS account and have created an Elastic Beanstalk environment.
